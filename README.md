# Purpose 

I developed a dynamic movie web application using React, integrating with The Movie Database API to display trending movies, categories, and search results. The application leverages React Router for seamless navigation and includes custom hooks for efficient data fetching and state management. With a responsive design and intuitive user interface, users can explore detailed information about movies and categories with ease. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, API-driven front-end applications with modern web technologies.
